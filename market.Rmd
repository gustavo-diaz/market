## Other stuff

Section in progress. Things that may be missing or understated in current materials.

- Working on text analysis modeling to analyze citation patterns in methodology across social sciences as part of postdoc duties

- Attending a grant writing workshop in the Fall, focus on preparing an application for an NSF-equivalent grant in Canada

- Dissertation data collection combines text analysis and supervised learning to create most up to date data set of Brazilian local anti-corruption audits

- Dissertation got poster award at Latin American Polmeth 2019

- Cool places I have interviewed but not taken jobs at that may make people feel like they need to hire me before someone else does: 

> Penn State, University of Konstanz, University of Birmingham, Howard University, William & Mary, KDI School of Public Policy and Management, Carlos III-Juan March Institute of Social Sciences, University of Melbourne

- Went to EITM at Emory in 2019

- Have experience mentoring an undergrad RA. Used it as an excuse so we could both learn text analysis. Student got job as data consultant after college. I claim all the credit

- Last 3 years have been marked by: Pandemic, parenting, moving, escaping from hurricane, immigration troubles, family illness. This is the first summer since 2020 without a major life thing going on. Feel free to weave that in your assessment of my productivity if you feel it may help
