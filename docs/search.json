We are interested in candidates whose research uses modern statistical methodology to answer substantive research questions in political science, or whose methodological research deepens our understanding of quantitative political methodology, broadly understood (e.g., statistics, computational methods, causal inference, etc.). The successful candidate will teach courses in statistical methods and research design at the graduate and undergraduate levels.  \n \nOpen-rank Professor in Political Methodology - Department of Political Science - Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyLetters: Jake, Matt, Michelle  Deadline: September 15, 2024  Delivery: Receive email  Notes: NA  \n \nAssistant Professor in Computational Social Science - Department of Political Science - Stony Brook UniversityLetters: Jake, Matt, Michelle  Deadline: September 16, 2024  Delivery: Interfolio  Notes: Michael Peress search committee chair.
